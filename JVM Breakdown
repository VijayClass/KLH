-> Break down of Virtual Machine(JAVA): 

->JVM : -> Java Virtual Machine

-> Class Loader Subsystem: 
		-> Load the members onto Runtime Data Area
            -> Bootstrap Class Loader
                          -> will load the files from rt.jar(Runtime Java Archive) 
            -> Extension class Loader
			  -> it is child class of Bootstrap
			  -> it loads all the extention/external files
 	    -> System/Application Class Loader
			  -> Class from Class Path 
-> Runtime Data Area:
                -> Memory Created while Runtime
	-> Method Area
		-> Class And Interface will Get the memory 
                -> All the static members will the memory 
	-> Heap Area
		-> All the instance members will get memory 
 	-> Java Stack Area
                -> Execution Takes place over here
 		-> It follows LIFO
		-> main will come's first and leaves last
	-> PC Register
		-> Program Counter Register
		-> Every Method will get memory, and store the count of No of instruction Executed
	-> Native Method Area 
		-> Method with native keyword are known as Native methods. Native method will have Platform Dependent Code(C/C++) 

-> Execution Engine:
   
   -> Intepreter:
          -> Interperter  will Call the main Method and start the execution 
	  -> Interpreter call handle non stream Instructions  
   -> JIT compiler:  
	  -> JIT -> Just in time Compiler
	  -> JIT Compiler will Handle Stream Instruction
